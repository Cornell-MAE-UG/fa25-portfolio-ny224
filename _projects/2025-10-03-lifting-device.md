For class, we were asked to design a mechanism to lift an object of maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. We are given:
- 150cm x 50cm Design space
- 1x Rigid bar of fixed length (our choice)
- 3x Pin supports (2 must be on the ground)
- 1x Linear actuator (chosen from an [online catalog](https://www.tolomatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2700-4000_29_IMA_cat.pdf))
